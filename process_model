We will use the spiral model in order to develop the course schedule creator. The product will change over time as more features are added, so an evolutionary model is necessary. We will start by giving the user basic functionality, which will include the ability to search for courses, add/remove course selections, and set different criteria such as available timeslots so that a schedule can be generated.

Future versions of the product will provide additional features to the user, such as the ability to sort and rank generated schedules, export schedules as a list of five-digit UTD class codes, or give the user the ability to blacklist specific professors.

Additional features will also introduce additional software issues, so making use of the spiral model will allow us to address these issues as they appear in the development process.
